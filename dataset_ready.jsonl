He denies history of trauma or past tuberculosis (TB). He was later found to be HIV-positive with a CD4 count of 331 cells/μL.. Chief complaint: Back pain and progressive difficulty in walking.. History of present illness: His troubles started 1 year earlier with back pain, for which he presented to a local health centre and was given paracetamol, without improvement. Over the following weeks, he developed difficulty in walking and ‘pins and needles’ sensation in his legs. Three months after the first visit, he presented again to the same health centre with a slightly elevated temperature (37.5°C, 99.5°F). He was given antimalarials, a single dose of praziquantel, and paracetamol. He consulted a local traditional healer who applied tattoos to his chest and back. Over the following 6 months, his condition further deteriorated, and he finally became bedridden. The patient denies fever, night sweats, weight loss, chronic cough, haematuria, or diarrhoea. He is continent for stool and urine.. Exposure and epidemiology: Originates from Malawi. Consulted a local traditional healer. Drinks locally brewed beer (Chibuku). Lives in an urban area. Context of resource-limited settings in sub-Saharan Africa. Was given antimalarials and praziquantel previously, suggesting possible exposure to malaria and schistosomiasis, although no active infection was confirmed at that time. Later found to be HIV-positive.. Vitals: Upon initial re-presentation, his temperature was slightly elevated (37.5°C, 99.5°F). At later clinical examination, he was afebrile with normal vital signs.. Physical exam: He looks well and is afebrile. There is tenderness over the lower thoracic spine. Severe spasticity of both legs with contractures. Power in his legs is 1/5 (visible muscle flicker). Deep tendon reflexes of the lower limbs are exaggerated. The plantar reflexes are upgoing. There is a sensory level for pain and temperature sensation between T9 and T11, with diminished joint sense in his big toes bilaterally. The examination of his cranial nerves and the upper limbs is normal. Tattoos from a traditional healer are present on his chest and back.. Labs and diagnostics: Full blood count results are normal. HIV test was positive; his CD4 count was 331 cells/μL. His urine dipstick was normal. There were no ova of Schistosoma spp. detected in his urine and stool. Spinal radiograph showed a collapse of the T11 vertebral body as well as soft tissue swelling around the spine. Chest radiography was normal. Abdominal ultrasound examination was normal.. Management and clinical course: The patient was initially given paracetamol, antimalarials, and praziquantel, and also consulted a traditional healer. Following admission and diagnostic workup (HIV test, Schistosoma tests, spinal/chest radiography, abdominal ultrasound), a presumed diagnosis of spinal TB was made. He was started on standard first-line antituberculous treatment and Vitamin B6 to prevent peripheral neuropathy. Physiotherapy and intensive guardian counseling were initiated. A spinal surgeon did not recommend surgical intervention at that time, suggesting a review in 3 months. The patient was discharged home, with the hospital palliative care team involved for monthly home visits. At 4 weeks, he was followed up in the HIV outpatient clinic; his neurological deficits were unchanged, and he was started on antiretroviral therapy. At the 3-month follow-up by the palliative care team, the patient reported some subjective improvement in his gait, though clinically his deficits remained unchanged.

Chief complaint: Difficulty in walking.. History of present illness: Illness started suddenly just over 2 years ago. He first noticed his legs feeling heavy and trembling, leading to difficulty walking and a tendency to fall. Since that day, he has been unable to stand or walk unaided. He now stands on his toes and drags his legs with the aid of a stick. He denies any history of fever, pain, sensory, bladder, or bowel symptoms, or disease progression.. Exposure and epidemiology: Lives in a village in northern Tanzania, a rural area where the main staple food crop is cassava. His diet for the 2 months before the illness was almost exclusively cassava. Identical cases had occurred in his own and neighboring villages at around the same time.. Vitals: Normal vital signs.. Physical exam: General examination is unremarkable. Neurological examination: fully orientated, higher mental function normal. Cranial nerves normal, but bilateral optic pallor noted on fundoscopy. Limbs reveal signs of spastic paraparesis with flexion contractures at both ankles and knees. Power in the legs is graded 3 to 4 out of 5 (just overcoming gravity), with knee extensors and foot dorsiflexors involved to the greatest extent. There is bilateral hypertonia, hyperreflexia, and sustained ankle clonus with extensor plantar responses. Arms are normal apart from generalized hyperreflexia. No impairment or loss of sensation. A lumbar lordosis with thoracic kyphoscoliosis is noticeable only on standing.. Labs and diagnostics: Full blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, blood glucose, creatinine, and urine analysis are all normal. Microscopy of urine and stool specimens does not show any ova of Schistosoma species. HIV serology and VDRL are negative. Lumbar puncture is normal. Radiographs of the chest and thoracolumbar spine are normal.. Management and clinical course: There is no cure for konzo, resulting in permanent spastic paraparesis. Management is directed at support, symptomatic improvement, and disease prevention. Patients can walk with the aid of a stick or crutches, and some may benefit from a wheelchair. Muscle relaxants have a limited role due to ineffectiveness and high cost. Surgical treatment involving Achilles tendon lengthening operations has proved useful in selected patients. Due to the severity of his contractures, he should be assessed for surgery. At 6 and 12-month follow-up, findings were unchanged with permanent spastic paraparesis. He was not referred for surgery due to lack of resources and the extent of the epidemic. He uses one stick with very restricted mobility and works as a shoe repairer in his village..", "label": "Konzo", "images": ["image-output\\Case-24\\page1_img1.jpeg"]}

Vitals: Vital signs are normal and the patient is afebrile.. Physical exam: His left lower leg and foot are grossly swollen; the skin is hyperaemic and feels hot. There are several cauliflower-like masses and oval plaque-like lesions on his left lower leg and foot. The lesions are partly erythematous, partly fungating and purulent, oozing a bad odour.. Labs and diagnostics: Radiography of the left leg and foot showed no bone involvement. Direct microscopic investigations of wet film lesion scrapings revealed characteristic brownish, round, thick-walled, multiseptate sclerotic cells typical of chromoblastomycosis. Use of 10% potassium hydroxide solution made the fungal cells more readily visible. Bacterial culture of the pus grew Escherichia coli. PCR from skin tissue was positive and sequencing revealed 100% similarity with Fonsecaea pedrosoi, F. monophora and F. nubica. Liver function tests and serum glucose were monitored during treatment and remained normal.. Management and clinical course: Secondary bacterial superinfection was suspected. Iodine-based antiseptics were applied locally and oral antibiotics were started, initially cloxacillin and metronidazole. After bacterial culture results, antibiotics were changed to co-trimoxazole, guided by susceptibility testing. Antifungal treatment was initiated with itraconazole (400mg/d for 7 days monthly pulse therapy). Surgical debridement of all lesions was performed. Oral terbinafine (initially 500mg/d, later 750mg/d) was added for 9 months, and local terbinafine ointment was applied for 6 months.

Labs and diagnostics: FBC: Thrombocytopenia of 81 x 10^9/L (reference: 150–300), otherwise normal. CRP: 55 mg/L (reference: <5). AST: 62 U/L (reference: 10–50 U/L). ALT: 106 U/L (reference: 10–50). Dengue NS1 antigen test: Negative. Rapid diagnostic test for malaria (detects Plasmodium falciparum-specific histidine-rich protein II and panmalarial aldolase): Negative. Later, thick blood film showed Plasmodium species trophozoites at a density of 920/μL. Thin film microscopy by a head parasitologist identified morphological characteristics compatible with Plasmodium malariae or P. knowlesi. Species-specific PCR confirmed mono-infection with P. knowlesi.. Management and clinical course: A thick blood film initially showed Plasmodium species trophozoites, but the species could not be determined. Non-falciparum malaria was suspected due to the negative RDT. The patient was admitted to the infectious diseases ward. Treatment was initiated with atovaquone/proguanil 250/100mg, 4 tablets once daily for 3 days. The patient rapidly recovered and was discharged on the fourth day. Further microscopy by a head parasitologist suggested P. malariae or P. knowlesi, which was definitively confirmed as Plasmodium knowlesi by species-specific PCR..", "label": "Knowlesi Malaria", "images": ["image-output\\Case-92\\page2_img1.jpeg", "image-output\\Case-92\\page2_img2.jpeg"]}

{"id": "Case-94", "text_input": "Patient information: A 20-year-old woman from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. She resides in a village, where people live from agriculture, has no relevant past medical history and is the mother of three children.. Chief complaint: Fever and a disseminated vesiculopustular skin rash.. History of present illness: The patient experienced fever, malaise, headache, dry cough, and swelling of the neck, followed by a disseminated skin rash that appeared 2 days after the initial symptoms. The skin lesions first appeared on the face and then spread centrifugally over her body, including the palms and soles of her feet as well as the oral mucosa. The lesions have developed from initial macules to papules, then to vesicles and finally to pustules. The oral mucosal lesions are painful and make drinking and eating difficult.. Exposure and epidemiology: The patient resides in a village in a rural area of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. She was born after the worldwide smallpox vaccination programmes were stopped in the early 1980s. Monkeypox is endemic in rural regions of Central Africa, with human cases and small outbreaks confined to remote villages, believed to result from close contact between humans and wild animals. Exposure is often difficult to pinpoint in areas where contact with animals through household rodent infestations and hunting or preparation of bushmeat from a variety of species is common.. Vitals: Temperature 38°C (100.4°F), pulse 110 beats per minute, blood pressure 105/82 mmHg.. Physical exam: Disseminated uniform umbilicated vesiculopustular skin lesions, ranging from 0.5 to 1 cm in diameter, all over the body with a predilection for the face, the hands and the feet. Generalized lymphadenopathy with prominent swelling of the cervical lymph nodes. The examination of the lungs, heart, abdomen and the CNS is unremarkable.. Labs and diagnostics: WBC: 4.4 x 10^9/L (neutrophils: 73%, lymphocytes: 21%). Haemoglobin: 12.3 g/dL. ESR: 75 mm/h (reference <20 mm/h).. Management and clinical course: Clinical management was exclusively supportive. The patient made an uneventful recovery, however, with scarring from the skin lesions..", "label": "Monkeypox", "images": ["image-output\\Case-94\\page1_img1.jpeg", "image-output\\Case-94\\page3_img1.jpeg"]}
