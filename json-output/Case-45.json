  "patient_information": "A 2-month-old baby girl from Vientiane, Laos. She was born at term and had been very well until 3 days previously. Her mother is a 24-year-old rice farmer.",
  "chief_complaint": "3 days of irritability, dyspnoea, and grunting.",
  "history_of_present_illness": "The 2-month-old baby girl presented with 3 days of irritability, dyspnoea, and grunting. Her mother reported the baby suddenly became unwell, but was neither feverish nor coughing. The infant was born at term and had been very well until 3 days prior. She had been breastfeeding poorly and was noted to have been grunting. The mother reported that her child had been exclusively breastfed and that she had practiced food avoidance since delivery, specifically avoiding beef, pork, vegetables, and fruits. The mother also reported having symptoms of thiamine deficiency herself, including anorexia, weakness, a husky voice, and paresthesias affecting her limbs.",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "The patient is a 2-month-old girl from Laos, a suitable endemic setting (South-east Asia). Her mother is a rice farmer. Prolonged food avoidance post-partum is common in lowland Lao culture, which includes milled glutinous rice but avoids fruits and vegetables. The mother practiced food avoidance since delivery, avoiding beef, pork, vegetables, and fruits. She also presented with symptoms suggestive of thiamine deficiency. Infantile beriberi occurs in exclusively breastfed babies whose mothers have thiamine deficiency from inadequate thiamine intake. It is relatively common in Laos due to prolonged maternal food avoidance.",
  "vitals": "Temperature: 37.0°C (98.6°F), Pulse: 140 bpm (normal range 100–160), Respiratory rate: 40 breath cycles per minute (normal range 30–60). Blood pressure was not taken.",
  "physical_exam": "Irritable infant, crying and grunting. Dyspnoeic, central cyanosis, hepatomegaly, and oedematous extremities. The rest of the physical examination appeared normal, with a clear chest and no heart murmurs. Shows signs of heart failure.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": "Blood samples were taken from the child and the mother. Analysis showed that both were thiamine-deficient.",
  "differential_diagnosis": "Congenital heart disease, respiratory diseases (e.g. broncho-pneumonia, bronchiolitis and laryngitis), meningitis, and infantile beriberi (thiamine or vitamin B1 deficiency). Respiratory diseases were considered unlikely due to absence of cough, wheeze, fever, and a normal chest examination. Congenital heart disease was considered unlikely due to cyanosis starting well after birth, sudden onset of symptoms, and absence of a heart murmur. Meningitis was considered unlikely due to absence of fever or bulging fontanels. Infantile beriberi was considered most likely given the combination of dyspnoea, poor breastfeeding, abnormal cry, grunting, and swollen extremities in an endemic setting.",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "Intravenous thiamine (50 mg) was given immediately to the child after admission. The child quickly and dramatically responded. Six hours later, the baby was able to breastfeed normally and was discharged the following day. The mother was given oral thiamine supplementation and advised to return to a well-balanced diet including thiamine-rich foods.",
