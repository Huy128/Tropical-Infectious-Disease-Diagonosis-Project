  "chief_complaint": "Intermittent fever and some 'heaviness' on the left side of his abdomen. Massive splenomegaly and bicytopenia found during work-up.",
  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient reports intermittent fever and a feeling of 'heaviness' on the left side of his abdomen for some time (duration difficult to specify). There are no night sweats, and his weight appears to be stable. He had just been worked-up for splenomegaly and bicytopenia at the haematology department, but the underlying condition could not be established.",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "Migrated from rural Mali to Germany, arriving 1 year prior. During his journey, he crossed Niger and spent a few weeks at a detention centre in Libya until he made his way across the Mediterranean and through Italy to Germany.",
  "vitals": "Temperature 36.1°C (96.98°F), BP 120/80mmHg, pulse 64 bpm.",
  "physical_exam": "Appears clinically well. Spleen is massively enlarged (around 15 cm below the left costal margin). No clinical anaemia and no lymphadenopathy. Heart sounds are clear and there are no murmurs. The rest of the examination is normal. Abdominal Ultrasound showed the spleen at 21.8 cm in longitudinal diameter with homogenous parenchyma. The liver was normal in size and parenchyma, and the flow of the portal and splenic veins was normal. No lymphadenopathy and no free fluid.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": "WBC 3.3 x 10^9/L (Reference: 4–10); Neutrophils 2.29 x 10^9/L (Reference: 1.8–7.2); Lymphocytes 1.4 x 10^9/L (Reference: 1.5–4); Monocytes 0.28 x 10^9/L (Reference: 0.2–0.5); Eosinophils 0.12 x 10^9/L (Reference: <0.5); Haemoglobin 13.8 g/dL (Reference: 13–15); Platelets 124 x 10^9/L (Reference: 150–350); LDH 185 U/L (Reference: <220); Total bilirubin 0.5 mg/dL (Reference: 0.2–1.2); IgM 8.59 g/L (Reference: 0.4–2.3, almost 4-fold increased); CRP 0.5 (Reference: <0.5); ESR 9/21 mm/h (Reference: <15/30); Plasmodium spp. (thick and thin film) negative; P. falciparum IFAT 1:256 (Reference: <1:32, positive malaria serology). Mild bicytopenia. HIV serology negative; EBV and CMV serologies indicated previous infection. Serologies for schistosomiasis and leishmaniasis negative. Blood culture for Brucella species and bacterial endocarditis did not yield any pathogens. No ova of S. mansoni found in stool. PCR for P. falciparum came back positive (despite negative blood film).",
  "differential_diagnosis": "Lymphoma or leukaemia, Visceral leishmaniasis (VL), Schistosomiasis (chronic S. mansoni infection, 'pipestem fibrosis'), Bacterial endocarditis, Brucellosis, EBV and CMV infections, Hyperreactive malarial splenomegaly (HMS).",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "An HIV test, serologies for schistosomiasis and visceral leishmaniasis, and blood cultures for Brucella species and bacterial endocarditis were ordered. Malaria PCR was ordered. The patient received one single course of dihydroartemisinin/piperaquine. The reported episodes of fever subsided. Malaria PCR was still positive at follow-up 2 weeks later but has remained negative since then. IgM levels took 2 years to get back to normal. The size of the spleen slowly decreased, remaining slightly enlarged (14 cm in diameter) at his last visit. Authorities threatened deportation, but a medical letter indicating high risk for splenic rupture and certain death in rural Mali was recognized, allowing him to stay. The patient was monitored for 2.5 years, was well, spoke fluent German, went to school, learned to read and write, and planned to start vocational training to become a house painter.",
