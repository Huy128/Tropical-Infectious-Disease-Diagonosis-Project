  "patient_information": "A 46-year-old Thai woman, 158cm, 65kg (BMI 26kg/m2).",
  "chief_complaint": "2-month history of recurrent cutaneous and subcutaneous abscesses, progressive lymphadenopathy, and weight loss. During her stay in Thailand, she suffered from high fever, dry cough and fatigue.",
  "history_of_present_illness": "Symptoms started 6 to 8 weeks after her return from a family visit to northern Thailand. She developed recurrent cutaneous and subcutaneous abscesses, progressive lymphadenopathy, and weight loss over 2 months. Despite various antibiotic therapies, clinical symptoms and inflammatory markers deteriorated. Initial pus and blood cultures did not yield any growth, and histopathology of a lymph node biopsy showed non-specific lymphadenitis.",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "Returned from a family visit to northern Thailand, where symptoms (high fever, dry cough, fatigue) initially started 6 to 8 weeks prior to the onset of chronic symptoms.",
  "vitals": "Afebrile, blood pressure 130/80mmHg, pulse 80bpm, BMI 26kg/m2.",
  "physical_exam": "Enlarged, tender cervical, nuchal, inguinal and axillary lymph nodes (generalized lymphadenopathy). Massive, tender swelling of the upper eyelids. Disseminated fluctuant cutaneous and subcutaneous abscesses with surrounding erythema, discharging pus on slight pressure. Painful swelling of the left elbow. Otherwise normal physical examination.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": "WCC 30.8 x 10^9/L (Reference: 3.8–11), Haemoglobin 8.2 g/dL (Reference: 12.3–15.3), MCV 88 fL (Reference: 80–94), Platelets 592 x 10^9/L (Reference: 150–400), CRP 267 mg/L (Reference: <5), ESR >110 mm/h (Reference: <20). Initial pus, blood, skin, and lymph node cultures were sterile. Histopathology of initial lymph node biopsy showed non-specific lymphadenitis. Radiograph of the left elbow showed osteolytic lesions of the radial epicondylus, osteomyelitis, and articular effusion. Subsequent submandibular lymph node biopsy revealed fungal cells identified as Histoplasma capsulatum by PCR and later confirmed by culture. Histoplasma serology remained negative. CSF analysis revealed lymphocytic pleocytosis after a generalized seizure. No evidence of immunosuppression (e.g., HIV, diabetes mellitus) was found.",
  "differential_diagnosis": "Systemic infection, fungal infections (Histoplasmosis), mycobacterial infections, bacterial infections with special requirements for cultivation (Burkholderia pseudomallei, Brucella species, Francisella tularensis, Actinomyces species), underlying immunodeficiency (HIV infection, diabetes mellitus, antibody deficiency, impaired granulocyte function), rare autoimmune syndromes (idiopathic nodular panniculitis/Weber–Christian disease, aseptic abscesses syndrome). Initially suspected diagnosis was Melioidosis.",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "Patient had deteriorated despite various prior antibiotic therapies. Initially received imipenem for suspected melioidosis, which led to slight improvement in skin manifestations but persistently elevated inflammation parameters. Once Histoplasma capsulatum was confirmed, she was treated with liposomal amphotericin B (3mg/kg per day, total dose 3g). During this treatment, she developed a generalized seizure. Clinical state and laboratory findings improved dramatically with liposomal amphotericin B. She was then started on itraconazole maintenance therapy for an additional 6 months. On follow-up, she presented in fair general condition with post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation at former abscess sites, resolution of enlarged lymph nodes, and partial recalcification of osteolytic lesions.",
  "final_diagnosis": "Disseminated Histoplasmosis with osteomyelitis and possible cerebral manifestation. Retrospectively, the febrile illness in Thailand was likely acute pulmonary histoplasmosis.",
