  "patient_information": "A 42-year-old British male expatriate living in Malawi for 18 months.",
  "chief_complaint": "Florid itchy rash, difficulty in breathing, and a feeling of impending death.",
  "history_of_present_illness": "Two days prior to admission, he believed he was bitten on his ankle by a tick while walking in the countryside. Twenty-four hours after this event, he developed a circumscribed, painless, indurated lesion on his left ankle, accompanied by fever and arthralgia. He visited a clinic where a blood film for malaria parasites was negative, and he was treated with paracetamol. On the day of admission, he developed a widespread itchy rash, followed by progressive inability to breathe and feeling faint. He has a family history of allergy. He previously kept bees in the United Kingdom and had frequently been stung without ill effect. Nine months prior, he had been bitten by insects while at Lake Malawi and developed an asthmatic attack which resolved spontaneously over 2 days.",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "Living in Malawi for 18 months. Possible tick bite 2 days prior to admission while walking in the countryside. History of insect bites 9 months prior at Lake Malawi. Visited a national game park 2 weeks before the current illness where he suffered numerous painful bites by tsetse flies.",
  "vitals": "Temperature 38°C, pulse rate 130 bpm, systolic blood pressure 60 mmHg.",
  "physical_exam": "Clammy, in a state of collapse, with a widespread urticarial rash. Respiratory distress with stridor and expiratory wheezes on chest auscultation. An indurated, circumscribed, painless, slightly erythematous swelling on the inside of his left ankle (later recognized as a trypanosomal chancre). On day 3 of admission, the stridor and wheezing ceased, the urticarial rash was replaced by a diffuse erythematous rash, his face became slightly puffy, and he developed a bad headache.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": "Haemoglobin 17.4 d/dL; white cell count 6.1 G/L (polymorphs 85%, lymphocytes 10%); erythrocyte sedimentation rate 5 mm/hour; blood film negative for malaria parasites; chest radiograph normal; stool and urine microscopy negative. Later, a thick blood film revealed 5 to 10 trypanosomes per high power field. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examined by lumbar puncture 24 hours after the first suramin dose was normal. Urine monitored weekly during suramin treatment showed protein, casts, and white cells, which disappeared a few weeks after treatment finished.",
  "differential_diagnosis": "Initially, a possible hypersensitivity reaction to a tick bite. Other differentials considered were invasive helminthiasis (acute schistosomiasis, acute fascioliasis, Loeffler’s syndrome), rickettsial disease, and connective tissue disease. Eosinophilia, typical for allergic reactions and helminth infections, was noted to be absent.",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "Initially, a diagnosis of anaphylactic shock was made, and 0.5ml of 1:1000 adrenaline was given by deep intramuscular injection with good effect. He was admitted to hospital and for the next 2 days was treated with intermittent intramuscular adrenaline, intravenous hydrocortisone, and oral antihistaminics for episodes of widespread urticaria associated with stridor and audible wheezing. On day 3, after his condition changed and trypanosomiasis was suspected, a thick blood film confirmed the diagnosis. He was given a test dose of suramin 0.25 g, followed by 0.5 g two days later, 1.0 g another two days later, and then weekly doses of 1.0 g to a total of 5.75g without ill effect. CSF was examined 24 hours after the first suramin dose to assess for CNS invasion (normal). His urine was monitored weekly during suramin treatment, showing transient protein, casts, and white cells which resolved after treatment.",
  "final_diagnosis": "Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT), specifically East African trypanosomiasis (Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense).",
