Pupils are 2mm and reactive, and extraocular movements are normal by oculocephalic manoeuvres. No papilloedema on direct ophthalmoscopy. With stimulation, there is decerebrate posturing that resolves spontaneously. Cardiac examination reveals a gallop rhythm.

  "management_and_clinical_course": "A lumbar puncture was performed with normal findings. Blood cultures were taken. Ophthalmoscopy revealed white-centred haemorrhages. The patient was administered artesunate 2.4mg/kg IV in A&E and admitted to the high-dependency unit for frequent monitoring. Artesunate was repeated at 12 and 24 hours, then once daily. An EEG showed diffuse slowing but no epileptiform activity. Twelve hours post-admission, the child had a short (1 minute) generalized seizure that spontaneously resolved and did not recur. Forty hours after admission, her Blantyre Coma Score improved to 4/5. The child was discharged home on hospital day five with a neurology clinic follow-up scheduled after 4 weeks.",
