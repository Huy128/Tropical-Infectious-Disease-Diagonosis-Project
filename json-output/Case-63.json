Lively, symmetrical tendon reflexes in the legs without clonus or pathological plantar reflexes, and no other abnormalities in the neurological examination.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": "Previous urine microscopy from local clinic: Schistosoma haematobium eggs identified. Abdominal ultrasound after attempted micturition: large bladder residue without further abnormalities. Full blood count: normal absolute WBC (9 x 10^9/L) with relative eosinophilia of 21.8% (reference range: 1â€“6%) and an absolute eosinophil count of 1.15 x 10^9/L (reference: <0.45 x 10^9/L). ALT slightly elevated. Creatinine and CRP were normal. HIV test negative. VDRL negative. Current stool and urine microscopy were normal (after previous treatment). Serological tests for schistosomiasis were not available. Spinal MRI: An enhancing 1cm lesion was seen at the anterior aspect of the conus, with associated high T2 signal representing oedema extending from the lower end of the conus to the level of T9. Additionally, nodular thickening of the urine bladder wall was observed at the base and the posterior aspect.",
