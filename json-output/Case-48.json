  "patient_information": "A 31-year-old woman from northern Tanzania, married with 3 children (the last born is 12 months old). She does not smoke or take alcohol. Her HIV status during her last pregnancy was negative. There is no past or family history of similar illness and no history of trauma.",
  "chief_complaint": "Acute flaccid paraplegia with loss of power and feeling in her legs.",
  "history_of_present_illness": "She was perfectly well up until 2 days earlier when she felt acute, severe, continuous, burning back pain which radiated band-like to the level of her umbilicus, unrelieved by analgesics or position. Within 12 hours, the pain lessened, but she developed numbness in her feet and legs ascending to the level of her waist, loss of power in her legs, and loss of control of her bladder.",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "From northern Tanzania. History of a febrile illness 3 weeks previously, treated as malaria.",
  "vitals": "Normal vital signs.",
  "physical_exam": "Well nourished. General examination is unremarkable; there is no spinal tenderness, deformity or gibbus. Neurological examination: fully orientated, normal higher mental functions, normal cranial nerves (including fundoscopy) and upper limbs. Lower limbs: unable to move legs, flaccid paraparesis with a sensory level at T10. Feet are in a slightly plantar-flexed position. Tone is reduced bilaterally, power is reduced (MRC grade 1/5) in all muscle groups. Reflexes are absent bilaterally, and plantar reflexes are extensor. Sensation is reduced to light touch to the level of the umbilicus. Joint position sense is impaired in the feet and ankles, and vibration sense is absent to the anterior iliac crest bilaterally.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": "Planned investigations included full blood count, ESR, blood glucose, renal and liver function tests, HIV serology, VDRL test, schistosomiasis serology, urine and stool analysis for ova of Schistosoma species. Lumbar puncture with measurement of opening pressure and testing cell differentiation, CSF protein, glucose, Gram and Ziehl-Neelsen stain, Xpert MTB/RIF for M. tuberculosis and VDRL. Imaging: x-rays of the chest and spine, spinal CT/MRI. \n\nResults: Full blood count, renal and liver function tests were normal. ESR: 19 mm/h (elevated, normal <10). Random blood glucose: 5.6 mmol/l (normal). HIV-Serology and p24 Antigen: negative. VDRL: negative. Schistosomiasis-serology: negative. Urine for ova of S. haematobium: negative. Stool for ova of S. mansoni: negative. Spinal tap: CSF opening pressure normal and looked clear. CSF white cell count: 11 cells/μl (90% lymphocytes) (elevated, normal 0–5). CSF protein: 1.11 g/L (elevated, normal <0.45). CSF glucose: 3.9 mmol/l (borderline high, normal 2.8–3.8). Gram stain: negative. Ziehl-Neelsen stain: negative. Xpert MTB/RIF: negative. VDRL in the CSF: negative. X-rays of her chest and thoracolumbar spine were normal.",
  "differential_diagnosis": "Neuroanatomical differential diagnoses for flaccid paraparesis included lesions of peripheral nerves (polyneuropathies or polyradiculoneuropathies) and acute lesions of the spinal cord (myelopathies). Clinicolaboratory differential diagnoses for acute non-compressive flaccid paraparesis localized in the spinal cord included acute spinal cord inflammation (acute transverse myelitis) and vascular spinal cord ischaemia ('spinal stroke').",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "Management was based on principles of establishing and treating the cause and preventing complications. Treatment included corticosteroids and acyclovir. General measures included strict 2-hourly turning, frequent passive movements, urinary catheterization (as she had a non-functioning bladder), and adequate analgesia. Counselling of patient and family was emphasized, with active involvement of family members/guardians in physiotherapy and mobilization. The patient partially improved and was discharged after 3 weeks. The power in her legs had slightly improved (MRC 2-3/5), and she was discharged with a urinary catheter in situ. She will be reviewed in the outpatient department.",
