  "differential_diagnosis": "Bacterial co-infection (especially Salmonella species), scrub typhus (Orientia tsutsugamushi), murine typhus (Rickettsia typhi), leptospirosis, tuberculosis, dengue fever, artemisinin-resistant falciparum malaria, incorrect dose of artemether, poor quality artemether, issues with intestinal absorption of the medicine.",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "The patient was treated with oral quinine sulphate 10 mg/kg every 8 hours and doxycycline 100 mg every 12 hours for 7 days. His fever cleared 35 hours after starting this therapy, and he was discharged well. Investigations later revealed the intramuscular artemether initially used only contained 59 mg (74% of stated 80 mg), indicating it was substandard. This substandard quality, combined with an likely underdosed regimen (approx. 1.0 mg/kg/day instead of 1.6 mg/kg/day after loading) and inadequate duration (5 days instead of 7), was identified as the reason for the poor initial clinical response. No evidence was found for any other infections.",
