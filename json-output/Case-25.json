  "patient_information": "A 72-year-old male farmer from Laos.",
  "chief_complaint": "Extensive, painful verrucous skin lesions on his left foot and lower leg.",
  "history_of_present_illness": "Ten years prior, he had a leech bite on the dorsum of his left foot. One week later, a small painless red nodule developed at the bite site. Over the following years, the lesion slowly increased in size, and further lesions developed and spread up to his knee. Three days before admission, his ankle became painful and swollen.",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "A 72-year-old male farmer from northern Laos. History of a leech bite on the dorsum of his left foot 10 years prior.",
  "vitals": "Vital signs are normal and the patient is afebrile.",
  "physical_exam": "His left lower leg and foot are grossly swollen; the skin is hyperaemic and feels hot. There are several cauliflower-like masses and oval plaque-like lesions on his left lower leg and foot. The lesions are partly erythematous, partly fungating and purulent, oozing a bad odour.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": "Radiography of the left leg and foot showed no bone involvement. Direct microscopic investigations of wet film lesion scrapings revealed characteristic brownish, round, thick-walled, multiseptate sclerotic cells typical of chromoblastomycosis. Use of 10% potassium hydroxide solution made the fungal cells more readily visible. Bacterial culture of the pus grew Escherichia coli. PCR from skin tissue was positive and sequencing revealed 100% similarity with Fonsecaea pedrosoi, F. monophora and F. nubica. Liver function tests and serum glucose were monitored during treatment and remained normal.",
  "differential_diagnosis": "Chronic verrucous skin lesions: sporotrichosis (Sporothrix schenckii), chromoblastomycosis, mycetoma (eumycetoma or actinomycetoma). Mycobacterial infections (cutaneous tuberculosis, lepromatous leprosy, infections with atypical mycobacteria). Cutaneous leishmaniasis. In HIV-positive patients, Kaposiâ€™s Sarcoma. Non-infectious causes: squamous cell carcinoma, sarcoidosis, chronic eczema, psoriasis. Acute localized inflammatory signs: bacterial superinfection or deep vein thrombosis.",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "Secondary bacterial superinfection was suspected. Iodine-based antiseptics were applied locally and oral antibiotics were started, initially cloxacillin and metronidazole. After bacterial culture results, antibiotics were changed to co-trimoxazole, guided by susceptibility testing. Antifungal treatment was initiated with itraconazole (400mg/d for 7 days monthly pulse therapy). Surgical debridement of all lesions was performed. Oral terbinafine (initially 500mg/d, later 750mg/d) was added for 9 months, and local terbinafine ointment was applied for 6 months. Liver function tests and serum glucose were monitored and remained normal. The lesions healed uneventfully with some residual swelling and hypopigmentation.",
  "final_diagnosis": "Chromoblastomycosis due to Fonsecaea pedrosoi, F. monophora and F. nubica, with secondary bacterial superinfection by Escherichia coli.",
