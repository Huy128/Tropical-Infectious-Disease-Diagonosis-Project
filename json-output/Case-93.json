  "management_and_clinical_course": "Received presumptive treatment for malaria, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and supportive care. Over the next 3 days, he developed increasing hepatic encephalopathy, renal failure, coma, and DIC with increasing spontaneous bleeding. Chest x-ray showed bilateral pulmonary infiltrates compatible with ARDS. Repeat laboratory results on day 3 showed deterioration of kidney function (creatinine 6.5 mg/dL, urea 120 mg/dL) and a sudden drop in liver transaminases (AST 100 U/L, ALT 200 U/L), likely indicating acute hepatic disintegration.
