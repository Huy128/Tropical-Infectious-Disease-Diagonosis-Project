  "patient_information": "A 32-year-old Malawian man with a history of HIV infection (tested positive and started on antiretroviral therapy (ART) and co-trimoxazole prophylaxis 2 months prior, with a recent CD4 count of 95 cells/μL) and treated for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) sputum smear-negative pulmonary tuberculosis 12 years ago.",
  "chief_complaint": "Painfully swollen neck, productive cough, chest pain, weight loss, fevers, and night sweats.",
  "history_of_present_illness": "A 32-year-old Malawian man presented to the outpatient department with a 6-week history of productive cough and chest pain associated with weight loss, fevers, and night sweats. He also noted that his neck had swollen and was painful. He had been tested HIV positive and started on ART and co-trimoxazole prophylaxis 2 months earlier, with a recent CD4 count of 95 cells/μL. He was treated for AFB sputum smear-negative pulmonary tuberculosis 12 years ago. After 3 weeks of initial TB repeat treatment, he did not improve, still having fevers, night sweats, lack of appetite, and his neck glands had further swollen and become clearly fluctuant.",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "From Malawi, where multi-drug resistance for TB is uncommon. HIV positive, residing in sub-Saharan Africa.",
  "vitals": "Temperature 39.2°C (102.56°F), pulse 112 bpm, respiratory rate 28 breath cycles per minute, normal blood pressure.",
  "physical_exam": "Moderately ill, pale, sweating. Large, matted lymph glands palpable in his neck. The rest of the examination was unremarkable. After 3 weeks of treatment, the glands in the neck had further swollen and were clearly fluctuant.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": "Full blood count: WBC 14.3 x 10^9/L (reference range: 4–10), haemoglobin 6.3 g/dL (reference range: 13–15), MCV 66 fL (reference range: 80–98), platelets 246 x 10^9/L (reference range: 150–350). Three sputum samples were negative for AFB. Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) of a neck gland yielded purulent material, with microscopy 2+ positive for AFB. Blood culture showed no growth. CD4 count on follow-up was 109 cells/μL; HIV-1 RNA <400 copies/mL. Repeat FBC results: WBC 7.8 x 10^9/L, haemoglobin 6.7 g/dL, MCV 84 fL, platelets 428 x 10^9/L. A second FNA of the neck swelling showed frank yellowish pus, with microscopic examination revealing numerous coccoid bacteria and polymorphonuclear lymphocytes. Bacterial culture results from the second FNA were never received.",
  "differential_diagnosis": "Tuberculous lymphadenitis (initial diagnosis), Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome (IRIS) of the unmasking type, atypical mycobacteria, non-adherence to TB treatment, malabsorption, drug resistance, bacterial lymphadenitis (likely Staphylococcus aureus), lymphoma (less likely), and paradoxical IRIS.",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "The patient was admitted and started on TB repeat treatment for tuberculous lymphadenitis with streptomycin, isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol, while continuing ART. After 3 weeks, he did not improve, and corticosteroids were initiated due to consideration of paradoxical IRIS. Subsequently, incision and drainage were performed for the increasingly fluctuant neck swelling, along with antibiotic treatment and a short course of corticosteroids. The patient recovered well while continuing TB treatment and ART.",
  "final_diagnosis": "Tuberculous lymphadenitis, superimposed bacterial lymphadenitis (likely Staphylococcus aureus), and Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome (IRIS) of the paradoxical type.",
