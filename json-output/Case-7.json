  "patient_information": "A 28-year-old Malawian male fisherman from a town on the southern shore of Lake Malawi. He was diagnosed with arterial hypertension 2 years prior but never took prescribed antihypertensive drugs. His medical and family history are otherwise unremarkable. A recent HIV test was negative.",
  "chief_complaint": "Progressive shortness of breath over the past 5 days.",
  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient experienced progressive shortness of breath over the past 5 days, accompanied by orthopnoea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea. He also developed bilateral, continuous, dull flank pain and constant nausea. He reported no cough or fever. He has a history of untreated arterial hypertension for two years.",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "The patient is a fisherman from a town on the southern shore of Lake Malawi and has been in regular contact with Schistosoma haematobium–infested water in Lake Malawi.",
  "vitals": "Blood pressure: 200/130 mmHg, Pulse: 66 bpm, Temperature: 36.8°C, Respiratory rate: 32 breath cycles per minute.",
  "physical_exam": "The patient was in respiratory distress but did not appear chronically ill. Conjunctivae were notably pale. Apex beat was slightly displaced, but heart sounds were clear and regular. Jugular venous pressure was not raised. Bilateral fine crackles were heard over the lung bases. Abdomen was flat and non-tender. There was bilateral renal angle tenderness, and the kidneys were ballottable. No peripheral oedema was present.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": "Laboratory results on admission:\n- WBC: 3.8 (10^9/L) (low)\n- Haemoglobin: 6.0 (mg/dL) (low)\n- MCV: 92 (fL) (normal)\n- Platelets: 187 (10^9/L) (normal)\n- Creatinine: 1200 (μmol/L) (very high)\n- BUN: 89.3 (mmol/L) (very high)\n- K+: 7.2 (mmol/l) (high)\n\nImaging:\n- Chest radiograph on admission (findings not detailed in text).\n- Ultrasound: Bilateral hydronephrosis with massive dilatation of the renal pelvis and calyces, very thin remaining renal parenchyma in both kidneys.\n\nOther Diagnostics:\n- Cystoscopy: Hyperaemic mucosa with multiple 'sandy patches' suggestive of granulomatous lesions in the mucosa; no tumour seen.",
  "differential_diagnosis": "Clinical impression included combined left-sided cardiac failure and renal failure. Potential causes for renal incompetence were considered to be primary renal pathological conditions (e.g., polycystic kidneys), secondary to hypertension, or post-renal obstruction with hydronephrosis. Chronic schistosomiasis with hydronephrosis was a top differential. Neoplasia was also considered.",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "Despite high doses of furosemide, the patient remained oliguric. Glucose and insulin were administered for hyperkalaemia. The patient deteriorated the next day, becoming drowsy, vomiting repeatedly, developing progressive bradycardia, and a new pericardial friction rub suggestive of uraemic pericarditis. A bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy was performed, and peritoneal dialysis (PD) was initiated in the intensive care unit due to the unavailability of haemodialysis. The patient improved rapidly, with cessation of vomiting and drowsiness, and resolution of the friction rub. He was discharged home on PD. Two months later, he was readmitted with fever and abdominal pain, treated for suspected bacterial peritonitis, but sadly died 3 weeks later in the hospital.",
  "final_diagnosis": "Urogenital schistosomiasis with combined left-sided cardiac failure and end-stage renal failure, leading to uraemic pericarditis and eventual death after complications (suspected bacterial peritonitis).",
