  "patient_information": "A 44-year-old male rice farmer from Laos, diagnosed with type 2 diabetes 4 years previously, non-compliant with oral antidiabetic drugs or follow-up.",
  "chief_complaint": "1-month history of fever, headache, generalized myalgia and arthralgia, and a painful swelling over the left scapula which gradually increased in size.",
  "history_of_present_illness": "A 44-year-old male rice farmer presented with a 1-month history of fever, headache, generalized myalgia and arthralgia, and a painful swelling over the left scapula. The swelling gradually increased in size without a history of preceding trauma, and no other lesions were noted. He has type 2 diabetes for 4 years but was non-compliant with medication or follow-up. The back lesion was incised and drained at a local health centre the previous week, and he had been taking cloxacillin 1g four times daily since. However, there was no improvement, and he deteriorated during the 2 days prior to admission with high fever, chills, and severe malaise.",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "Patient is a rice farmer from Southern Laos, presenting during the rainy season. This puts him at risk for melioidosis, especially with his immunocompromised status (diabetes mellitus). Infection is thought to occur via percutaneous inoculation through cuts and abrasions, common in rice field workers.",
  "vitals": "Fever of 40°C (104°F), heart rate 136bpm, blood pressure 140/80mmHg, respiratory rate 30 breath cycles per minute.",
  "physical_exam": "Appears septic, pale, and jaundiced. Left scapular region shows an erythematous swelling (2.5 x 4cm) with pus discharging from a central wound. No regional lymphadenopathy. Chest auscultation reveals bilateral crepitations and reduced breath sounds at both lung bases. Heart sounds are normal. Abdomen is soft without palpable organomegaly. Hypopigmented macular skin lesions of Pityriasis versicolor were also noted.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": "Blood tests: WBC 16.2 x 10^9/L (high), Polymorphs 92.1% (high), Haemoglobin 12.5 g/dL (normal), Platelets 112 x 10^9/L (low), Glucose 20.6 mmol/L (high), Serum creatinine 56 μmol/L (normal), Urea 6.8 mmol/L (normal), AST 131 U/L (high), ALT 83 U/L (high), Serum total bilirubin 111.2 μmol/L (high), Serum direct bilirubin 56.4 μmol/L (high).\nMicrobiology: Pus culture yielded B. pseudomallei after 48 hours. Blood culture also grew B. pseudomallei. Three throat swabs cultured on selective media failed to grow the organism.\nImaging: Chest radiograph revealed bilateral pleural effusions. Shoulder radiograph showed no evidence of bony involvement. Abdominal ultrasound showed hepatosplenomegaly without evidence of liver or splenic abscesses.",
  "differential_diagnosis": "Bacterial abscess with sepsis (possible causative organisms: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, other Streptococcus species, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Vibrio vulnificus, anaerobes). Melioidosis (highly suspected due to epidemiological and clinical risk factors including diabetes). Tuberculosis (less likely as abscesses are usually 'cold'). Disseminated fungal infection (unlikely without additional immunocompromise like HIV).",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "Initial empirical treatment with ceftriaxone and gentamicin. After 48 hours, with suspicion of melioidosis from laboratory alert, treatment was switched to ceftazidime. The patient improved within 7 days and was afebrile by day 14. He was then switched to oral co-trimoxazole to complete a 20-week course. Glycaemic control was established. No other foci of infection were detected. Discharged after 21 days of hospitalization, continuing oral 'eradication' treatment for 5 months. Patient remains well.",
