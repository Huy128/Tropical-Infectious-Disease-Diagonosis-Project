  "patient_information": "A 34-year-old male immigrant from Peru, living in Chile for 9 years. Body weight 44 kg, BMI 17.",
  "chief_complaint": "Severe chronic diarrhoea, colicky abdominal pain, and 20 kg weight loss.",
  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient presented with a 6-month history of severe chronic diarrhoea associated with colicky abdominal pain and weight loss of approximately 20 kg. For more than 12 years prior, he had suffered from recurrent episodes of diarrhoea and abdominal cramps, with the frequency of these episodes increasing in the past 2 years.",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "The patient originates from northern Peru, a tropical region highly endemic for Strongyloides stercoralis and HTLV-1. He has been living in Chile for the past 9 years. His family history includes his mother and one brother who suffered from chronic abdominal symptoms of unknown origin, leading to wasting and subsequent death at ages 45 and 28 years, respectively. His wife and one of his children were later found to have asymptomatic S. stercoralis infection, and his wife also tested HTLV-1 positive.",
  "vitals": "Afebrile. Exact temperature not specified.",
  "physical_exam": "Cachectic with severe loss of muscle mass and a body weight of 44 kg (BMI 17). Apart from slight pain on abdominal palpation, the physical examination was normal: liver and spleen were not enlarged, there was no palpable lymphadenopathy and no peripheral oedema.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": "Laboratory results on admission showed: WBC 11.7 x 10^9/L (elevated), Platelets 644 x 10^9/L (elevated), Haemoglobin 12.4 g/dL (low), Protein 4.9 g/dL (low), Albumin 2.2 g/dL (low), ESR 26 mm/h (elevated), HIV test negative. Abdominal CT scan and abdominal MRI were without any pathological findings. Oesophagogastroduodenoscopy appeared macroscopically normal. Histology of a duodenal biopsy showed signs of chronic duodenitis and multiple elongated structures compatible with a helminth infection. Further investigations included a fresh stool sample sent for Baermann testing, which demonstrated a high load of rhabditiform larvae of S. stercoralis. Numerous larvae were also present in respiratory secretions, but not in urine. HTLV-1 co-infection was confirmed by serology.",
  "differential_diagnosis": "Helminth infections such as Strongyloides stercoralis and Capillaria philippinensis were considered due to chronic diarrhoea and wasting. Intestinal protozoa like Cryptosporidium species or Cystoisospora belli were also mentioned as possibilities in immunocompromised patients. HTLV-1 infection was considered an important risk factor for S. stercoralis hyperinfection syndrome.",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "The patient was hospitalized and stabilized under symptomatic treatment and parenteral nutrition. After the histopathology report and subsequent parasitological confirmation of Strongyloides stercoralis larvae in stool and respiratory secretions, oral treatment with ivermectin (200 Î¼g/kg per day for 7 days) was initiated and repeated after 2 weeks. HTLV-1 co-infection was confirmed by serology. The patient recovered from diarrhoea and other abdominal symptoms within weeks. Parasitological follow-up examination after 3 months was negative. At that point, the patient had gained 13 kg and was without postprandial abdominal cramps for the first time in more than 10 years. Baermann testing of his family and other household members revealed asymptomatic S. stercoralis infection in his wife and one of the two children. His wife tested HTLV-1 positive, but both children were negative.",
