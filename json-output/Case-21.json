  "patient_information": "A 35-year-old Caucasian male, American postal worker with an unremarkable past medical history.",
  "chief_complaint": "Fatigue and a rash on his neck that started as a papule, associated with significant non-painful swelling and a pressure sensation in the neck. He also reported worsening malaise and neck swelling with mild difficulty breathing.",
  "history_of_present_illness": "A 35-year-old Caucasian male presented with fatigue and a rash on his neck that started as a papule 2 days earlier. The lesion was non-pruritic, but associated with significant non-painful swelling and a pressure sensation in the neck. He reported at least one episode of diaphoresis with mild confusion and headache, but no fever. He recalled a break in the skin at the site 3 days before while shaving. He had come to the clinic 24 hours earlier with similar symptoms, where blood cultures were obtained, and he was given one dose of a first-generation cephalosporin and discharged on a ten-day oral course. He returned due to worsening malaise and neck swelling associated with mild difficulty breathing.",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "The patient is a postal worker by profession. He had no contact with animals and no foreign travel within the previous year. He was later confirmed to be exposed during his occupation as a postal worker, handling contaminated mail, during a period when the United States was investigating a possible bioterrorism event.",
  "vitals": "Temperature 36.9°C (98.4°F), pulse 118 bpm, blood pressure 138/90mmHg, respiratory rate 20 breath cycles per minute.",
  "physical_exam": "Examination revealed a 2cm irregularly shaped, indurated non-tender patch on the left anterior neck with mild overlying erythema and several 2 to 3mm vesicles. The main lesion had a 6mm shallow ulceration. There was massive neck oedema, making lymph nodes difficult to assess. His neck circumference had increased from 57cm at baseline to a peak of 81cm. The remainder of the initial physical examination was normal.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": "Full blood count, Na+, K+, Cl HCO3, BUN, creatinine and random glucose were normal except for a mildly elevated haemoglobin at 18.7g/dL (reference range: 13.0–18.0g/dL). Blood cultures taken at the first clinic visit grew gram-positive rods. Gram stain and culture of the skin lesion obtained at the second visit were negative for B. anthracis. Stains for bacteria and immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of the skin biopsy performed at a reference laboratory showed abundant bacilli in the dermis and the presence of B. anthracis antigens, respectively. Serology revealed that antibody to protective antigen was present in convalescent serum.",
  "differential_diagnosis": "Bacterial ecthyma (Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus), rickettsial diseases, necrotic arachnidism (bite by brown recluse spider), rat-bite fevers (Streptococcus moniliformis and Spirillum minus), ulceroglandular tularaemia and bubonic plague. Cutaneous anthrax was considered the most important diagnosis given the epidemiological setting (bioterrorism investigation in the United States).",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "At the first clinic visit, after blood cultures were obtained, he was given one dose of a first-generation cephalosporin and discharged on a ten-day oral course. Upon returning due to worsening symptoms, the patient was admitted and received intravenous levofloxacin and ampicillin-sulbactam and recovered.",
