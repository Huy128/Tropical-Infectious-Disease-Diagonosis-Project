  "patient_information": "22-year-old male farmer from rural northern Ethiopia.",
  "chief_complaint": "Difficulty walking.",
  "history_of_present_illness": "Problem started 10 years ago when he woke from sleep and noticed weakness in both legs. There was no history of trauma or prodromal symptoms; he had been in excellent health before. The weakness in his legs rapidly progressed over 4 to 5 days, leading to him needing a cane for mobility. He had no back pain, sensory complaints, sphincter disturbance, or upper limb symptoms. His walking difficulty ultimately prevented him from farm work. The onset of illness coincided with a period of drought and famine.",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "From rural northern Ethiopia. During the onset of illness, his diet almost exclusively consisted of grass peas (Lathyrus sativus, local name guaya). He was engaged in hard physical labor on his family farm. His mother and three sisters consumed a similar diet but with smaller amounts of guaya. Several similar cases of weakness occurred among young male farmers in his village during the same period. At age 20, he moved to the capital city seeking an alternative job, migrating with another young male farmer from his village who had similar symptoms developed during the same drought period. There was no history of cassava exposure in the region.",
  "vitals": "Not mentioned.",
  "physical_exam": "Alert young man with a normal mental state. Gait is spastic ('scissor gait'), with foot-dragging and toe-scraping. Mild bilateral lower limb spastic weakness of pyramidal pattern, with pathological brisk deep tendon reflexes and sustained foot clonus. Extensor plantar response elicited on the right, equivocal on the left. Cranial nerves and upper limbs are normal. No sensory or bladder dysfunction.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": "Full blood count, liver and renal function tests, cerebrospinal fluid, nerve conduction studies, and electromyography were normal. HIV-1 serology was non-reactive. HTLV-1 and -2 serology and MRI were not available.",
  "differential_diagnosis": "Clinical syndrome identified as upper motor neuron lesion with spastic paraparesis. Most compressive, hereditary, infectious, and metabolic myelopathies were ruled out due to absence of radicular symptoms, sensory level, sphincter disturbance, back pain, non-progression, HIV-seronegativity, and negative family history. HTLV-associated myelopathy (HAM) was considered highly unlikely due to its typical insidious onset, slowly progressive course, and prominent bladder impairment and sensory symptoms. Neurocassavism (konzo) was considered improbable due to the absence of cassava exposure. Male gender, pre-onset physical exertion, excessive prolonged guaya consumption, and a history of similarly affected village members favored a toxico-nutritional disease called neurolathyrism.",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "The patient received physiotherapy and muscle relaxants, which achieved only mild, short-lasting improvement of his spasticity. A walking cane and wheelchair were provided. The patient was counselled to avoid further consumption of Lathyrus sativus. General management for neurolathyrism includes symptomatic treatment with anti-spastic drugs and physiotherapy, tendon and muscle release surgery for contractures, and provision of mobility aids. Prevention involves education to avoid L. sativus consumption and measures to reduce toxin burden, such as using metallic cooking utensils, adding antioxidant seasonings, soaking seeds in lemon water, and avoiding unripe seeds.",
  "final_diagnosis": "Neurolathyrism (a preventable neurotoxic myelopathy caused by excessive ingestion of Lathyrus sativus grass pea).",
