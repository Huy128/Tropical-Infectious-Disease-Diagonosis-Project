  "patient_information": "A 55-year-old Swiss couple, both fitness instructors.",
  "chief_complaint": "Husband: fever, myalgias, generalized weakness, shortness of breath, oxygen desaturation. Wife: similar complaints, cardiorespiratory failure, multi-organ failure, profuse bleeding.",
  "history_of_present_illness": "Husband developed fever (39°C, 102.2°F), myalgias, and generalized weakness on the flight back to Switzerland, which did not respond to symptomatic treatment. Four days later, at hospital presentation, he remained febrile, was too weak to walk unassisted or hold a newspaper, developed shortness of breath with oxygen desaturation, and had bilateral interstitial infiltrates on chest x-ray. He was transferred to the ICU for non-invasive ventilator support. Three weeks later, his wife presented with similar complaints and was admitted to the same hospital. She rapidly deteriorated over 24 hours, developed cardiorespiratory failure, and met criteria for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). She also experienced multi-organ failure requiring hemodialysis and developed profuse bleeding from puncture sites due to disseminated intravascular coagulation, requiring mass transfusions.",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "Travelled for 3 months from Ecuador to Chile. The last month of their trip was spent hiking, camping, and taking occasional mud baths in the Chile-Argentinian border region. This region is endemic for Andesvirus, with outdoor activities being a major risk factor. The husband and wife presented 3 weeks apart, raising the possibility of human-to-human transmission or acquisition from a common source.",
  "vitals": "Husband: BP 90/55 mmHg, pulse 120 beats per minute, oxygen saturation 94% on ambient air, temperature 39°C (102.2°F). Wife on admission: normal blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation, temperature 38.6°C (101.5°F).",
  "physical_exam": "Husband: No abnormal findings on cardiopulmonary auscultation. Wife on admission: No abnormal findings on auscultation. Later developed profuse bleeding from puncture sites.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": "Husband, on admission: WCC 7.3 G/L (reference: 3.0–10.5), 35% band neutrophils; platelets 48 G/L (reference: 150–450); CRP 68 mg/L (reference: <5); glomerular filtration rate >90 mL/min; transaminases normal. Chest x-ray showed bilateral interstitial infiltrates. Respiratory pathogen panel (including influenza A/B, parainfluenza, RSV, adenovirus, rhinovirus, bocavirus, coronavirus, human metapneumovirus) from nasopharyngeal swab was negative. HIV test was negative. Wife, on admission: WCC 1.88 G/L; platelets 98 G/L; CRP 7 mg/L; glomerular filtration rate >90 mL/min; transaminases normal. Chest radiography at presentation was normal, but later developed extensive bilateral infiltrates with pleural effusions. Both patients were confirmed by PCR and serology to be infected with Andesvirus (ANDV). CT of the chest for the wife on day 13 showed extensive and dense dorsal infiltrations and centrally placed ECMO cannulae.",
  "differential_diagnosis": "Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and possible multi-organ failure after travel to South America: influenza and other respiratory viruses (including New World hantaviruses due to cardiopulmonary disease, long incubation, and possible human-to-human transmission), pneumococcal pneumonia, rickettsial diseases (Rickettsia rickettsiae, scrub typhus), pulmonary plague, fungal infections (Histoplasmosis, Cryptococcosis), and severe malaria. Viral haemorrhagic fevers (yellow fever, dengue, New World arenaviruses) were largely excluded due to incubation times, with hantavirus infections being the exception (incubation up to 35 days).",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "Both patients were referred to a tertiary care setting. Initial management focused on securing cardiorespiratory function. Broad-spectrum antibiotics were indicated as empirical treatment. Standard hygiene and droplet precautions were taken. Husband was treated with non-invasive ventilation for 5 days and made a full recovery after a month of rehabilitation. His wife had a dramatic course, requiring nearly a full month on ECMO treatment, hemodialysis for multi-organ failure, and mass transfusions for haemorrhagic complications (DIC, bleeding at ECMO sites). She underwent several surgical interventions, developed nosocomial infections, and remained in intensive care for 5 months, followed by an additional 12 months in rehabilitation.",
