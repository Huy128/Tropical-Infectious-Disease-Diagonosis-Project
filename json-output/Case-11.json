  "patient_information": "A 45-year-old male security guard from Malawi. He is a non-smoker, drinks about one liter of Chibuku (locally brewed beer) per day. He is married with three children, who are all well. He resides in an urban area and used to work as a security guard but has been unemployed for the last 6 months because of his illness. He denies history of trauma or past tuberculosis (TB). He was later found to be HIV-positive with a CD4 count of 331 cells/μL.",
  "chief_complaint": "Back pain and progressive difficulty in walking.",
  "history_of_present_illness": "His troubles started 1 year earlier with back pain, for which he presented to a local health centre and was given paracetamol, without improvement. Over the following weeks, he developed difficulty in walking and ‘pins and needles’ sensation in his legs. Three months after the first visit, he presented again to the same health centre with a slightly elevated temperature (37.5°C, 99.5°F). He was given antimalarials, a single dose of praziquantel, and paracetamol. He consulted a local traditional healer who applied tattoos to his chest and back. Over the following 6 months, his condition further deteriorated, and he finally became bedridden. The patient denies fever, night sweats, weight loss, chronic cough, haematuria, or diarrhoea. He is continent for stool and urine.",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "Originates from Malawi. Consulted a local traditional healer. Drinks locally brewed beer (Chibuku). Lives in an urban area. Context of resource-limited settings in sub-Saharan Africa. Was given antimalarials and praziquantel previously, suggesting possible exposure to malaria and schistosomiasis, although no active infection was confirmed at that time. Later found to be HIV-positive.",
  "vitals": "Upon initial re-presentation, his temperature was slightly elevated (37.5°C, 99.5°F). At later clinical examination, he was afebrile with normal vital signs.",
  "physical_exam": "He looks well and is afebrile. There is tenderness over the lower thoracic spine. Severe spasticity of both legs with contractures. Power in his legs is 1/5 (visible muscle flicker). Deep tendon reflexes of the lower limbs are exaggerated. The plantar reflexes are upgoing. There is a sensory level for pain and temperature sensation between T9 and T11, with diminished joint sense in his big toes bilaterally. The examination of his cranial nerves and the upper limbs is normal. Tattoos from a traditional healer are present on his chest and back.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": "Full blood count results are normal. HIV test was positive; his CD4 count was 331 cells/μL. His urine dipstick was normal. There were no ova of Schistosoma spp. detected in his urine and stool. Spinal radiograph showed a collapse of the T11 vertebral body as well as soft tissue swelling around the spine. Chest radiography was normal. Abdominal ultrasound examination was normal.",
  "differential_diagnosis": "The neuroanatomical syndrome is localized to the spinal cord, presenting as spastic paraparesis with hyperreflexia, upgoing plantar reflexes, and a thoracic sensory level. Differential diagnoses for non-traumatic compressive spinal cord disease in sub-Saharan Africa include spinal TB ('Pott’s disease'), spinal metastases, and degenerative spinal disease (including slipped disc). Common causes of non-compressive spinal cord disease are schistosomiasis, autoimmune transverse myelitis, and HIV-associated vacuolar myelopathy.",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "The patient was initially given paracetamol, antimalarials, and praziquantel, and also consulted a traditional healer. Following admission and diagnostic workup (HIV test, Schistosoma tests, spinal/chest radiography, abdominal ultrasound), a presumed diagnosis of spinal TB was made. He was started on standard first-line antituberculous treatment and Vitamin B6 to prevent peripheral neuropathy. Physiotherapy and intensive guardian counseling were initiated. A spinal surgeon did not recommend surgical intervention at that time, suggesting a review in 3 months. The patient was discharged home, with the hospital palliative care team involved for monthly home visits. At 4 weeks, he was followed up in the HIV outpatient clinic; his neurological deficits were unchanged, and he was started on antiretroviral therapy. At the 3-month follow-up by the palliative care team, the patient reported some subjective improvement in his gait, though clinically his deficits remained unchanged. He was taking his antituberculous and antiretroviral medication regularly and was still waiting for a wheelchair.",
