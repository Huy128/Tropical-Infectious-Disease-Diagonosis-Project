  "patient_information": "25-year-old female primary school teacher from Malawi. HIV-positive, on first-line ART (tenofovir, lamivudine, efavirenz) for 6 months with good adherence (CD4 count 320 cells/μL on starting ART). Completed treatment for pulmonary tuberculosis 2 months ago.",
  "chief_complaint": "Abrupt onset of fever and confusion.",
  "history_of_present_illness": "Reported to be well at 8 a.m., confused by 10 a.m. and drowsy with a high fever and convulsions on admission at 11 a.m.",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "Patient is from Malawi. Mentions that in the meningitis belt, seasonal outbreaks of bacterial meningitis caused by Neisseria meningitis occur during the dry season. High HIV prevalence in many countries with increased incidence of acute bacterial meningitis.",
  "vitals": "Temperature 40°C (104°F), pulse 125bpm, blood pressure 125/68mmHg, oxygen saturation 93% on room air.",
  "physical_exam": "Restless and agitated; Glasgow Coma Scale 10/15. Pupils are equal and reactive with photophobia; neck is stiff and there is no rash. Plantar responses are down-going, Kernig’s sign is positive. Chest and abdominal examinations are unremarkable. Suffered a renewed seizure during the physical examination.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": "Blood results: WBC 10.5 x 10^9/L (elevated), Neutrophil count 8.9 x 10^9/L (elevated), Haemoglobin 8.9 g/dL (low), MCV 85 fL, Platelets 255 x 10^9/L, Creatinine 106 μmol/L (upper limit of reference), Random blood glucose 5.6 mmol/L. Spinal tap: CSF appears hazy; Leukocytes 35 cells/μL (60% neutrophils, elevated), Protein 2.6 g/L (elevated), Glucose 1.2 mmol/L (low). Rapid antigen test for Plasmodium falciparum is negative. CSF culture grew S. pneumoniae. Audiometry revealed a minor hearing loss in her right ear.",
  "differential_diagnosis": "Bacterial meningitis (most likely), tuberculous meningitis, cryptococcal meningitis. Less likely due to subacute presentation for TB/Cryptococcal and recent TB treatment. Cryptococcal meningitis also less likely due to CD4 count being too high. Listeria monocytogenes very unlikely as she is not pregnant. Other bacterial pathogens in HIV-infected adults include S. pneumoniae, group A streptococci, Staphylococcus aureus, invasive non-typhoidal salmonellae, Salmonella typhi, Escherichia coli and Haemophilus influenzae.",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "Immediate treatment priority was emergency resuscitation including rapid administration of antibiotics. A third-generation cephalosporin (e.g., ceftriaxone) at high dose or high dose benzylpenicillin plus chloramphenicol. Airway support and seizure control indicated. Adjunctive dexamethasone is not recommended in resource-limited settings in Africa; glycerol was shown to be harmful in adults. Lumbar puncture should be performed without delay. In the emergency department, she received ceftriaxone 2g IV, 10mg diazepam IV and 600mg phenobarbitone IV. Oxygen saturation improved with resuscitation. She received 10 days of IV ceftriaxone and recovered consciousness by day 3. Anticonvulsants were weaned by day 3. No further neurological impairment or seizures were noted.",
