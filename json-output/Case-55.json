  "patient_information": "A 40-year-old male farmer from the Peruvian Amazon. He was found to be HTLV-1-positive 10 years previously. A recent HIV ELISA test was negative. He appears fatigued and cachectic.",
  "chief_complaint": "Chronic productive cough and chest pain, dyspnoea on exertion, and weight loss of about 20kg over 4 months.",
  "history_of_present_illness": "A 40-year-old farmer from the Peruvian Amazon presented with a 4-month history of chronic productive cough, chest pain, dyspnoea on exertion, and weight loss of about 20kg. He denied diarrhoea, fever, or night sweats. Three and a half months earlier, he was hospitalized at a regional hospital for similar complaints. Three sputum smears for AFB were negative, and no tuberculin skin test was performed. An abnormal chest radiograph led to a presumptive diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB), and he received first-line TB therapy (isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol). Despite adherence, he showed no clinical improvement, with persistent productive cough and blood-streaked sputum, leading to referral to Lima with suspected multi-drug resistant TB (MDR TB). He was known to be HTLV-1 positive for 10 years, and a recent HIV test was negative. He denied recent travels.",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "Farmer from the Peruvian Amazon, a region where paracoccidioidomycosis is endemic in moist tropical areas. Infection occurs through inhalation of aerosolized conidia (spores) from the soil. TB is highly endemic in Peru, but MDR TB is uncommon in rural areas of the central Peruvian Amazon.",
  "vitals": "Temperature 37.2°C (98.96°F), blood pressure 120/75mmHg, pulse 70bpm regular, respiratory rate 15 breaths per minute.",
  "physical_exam": "Patient appears fatigued and cachectic. Few small, mobile, soft, non-tender cervical and retroauricular lymph nodes are palpable. Lungs showed crackles and rhonchi bilaterally. No hepatosplenomegaly. The rest of the physical examination was normal.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": "Initial: Three sputum smears for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) were negative. Chest radiograph was abnormal (report unavailable). HTLV-1-positive 10 years prior. Recent HIV ELISA negative. Platelets: 1093 x 10^9/L (reference range: 150–450), indicating thrombocytosis; rest of full blood count within normal limits. Further work-up: Tuberculin skin test negative. Two repeated AFB smears negative. Chest x-ray showed bilateral confluent reticulonodular infiltrates predominantly in the central and upper zones of both lungs, and multiple cavities in the right lung. Sputum KOH preparation revealed characteristic large budding yeast forms of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis. Culture grew P. brasiliensis.",
  "differential_diagnosis": "Multi-drug resistant TB (MDR TB), histoplasmosis, paracoccidioidomycosis (considered most likely), co-infection of TB (non-MDR) and paracoccidioidomycosis, paragonimiasis, pulmonary hydatid cyst.",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "Patient initially received first-line TB therapy (isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol) for 3 months based on a presumptive diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis, but showed no clinical improvement. After diagnosis of chronic paracoccidioidomycosis and given extensive pulmonary lesions and HTLV-1 co-infection, TB treatment was discontinued. The patient was started on amphotericin B followed by itraconazole (as opposed to itraconazole alone). The thrombocytosis was considered reactive to the underlying chronic infection. His long-term prognosis depends on the extent of pulmonary fibrotic sequelae.",
  "final_diagnosis": "Chronic (adult) paracoccidioidomycosis. The thrombocytosis was considered reactive to the underlying chronic infection. His HTLV-1 positivity and unusually extensive pulmonary lesions were noted.",
